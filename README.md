================
This aims to be a simple tutorial for mpc-hc
--------------------------------------------

###Why repo empty?
I will try my best to fill it in the rest of my life...contact me if you want to pull something, as I may miss notifications.

### Why we need a tutorial for a software already very easy to use?
Because some users don't know much about terms like AVC/H.264 or 10bits. On the other hand they ask why it dose not function as supposed or is there any more stuffs to improve the experience.
They are interested in learning more and becoming an advanced user.

### So who will read it?
Maybe no one, but I don't care

### Why using LaTeX?
I'm a Windows user and it was very difficult for me to do something regarded ease under Linux, for example compiling ProGit. If I were Ninja, maybe I could manage it. And I've read some introductions to Markdown and Docbook and decide to use a tool that I happend to (partly) understand. Well, LaTeX seems sophiscated but it will be far better than MS Office Word.

### In which language?
First Chinese then translated into English and French.

###What dose it mean Yokuwakaru
Yoku Wakaru in Japanese means "easy to understand"
