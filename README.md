简单易懂的Media Player Classic - Homecinema
--------------------------------------------

“简单易懂的Media Player Classic - Homecinema”这个项目初衷是希望给对鼓捣视频播放器感兴趣的普通用户一些简单的入门指导。

在无人问津的1.x版本和中途荒废的2.x版本之后，我终于有了写作第三版的想法，目前只是开了一个小坑。个人觉得之前的那个提纲改一改还是可以继续用的：

    Mpc-hc教学
    1.序言

    2.基本概念、片源

    分辨率、码率、流

    3.主流的视频编码格式

    MPEG2、Xvid、DivX、RM/RMVB、Wmv/vc-1、h.264/AVC、VPx

    4.主流的音频编码格式

    PCM、MP3、AAC、OGG/Vorbis、APE、FLAC、TTA、AC3

    5.主流的封装格式

    AVI、Vorbis、Matroska、MP4

    6.Mpc-hc简要绍介

    MPC、主要功能

    7.Mpc-hc的简单设置

    8.外挂滤镜介绍1：分离器、解码器

    Haali splitter、lavF splitter

    FFdshow、CoreAVC、Microsoft

    9.外挂滤镜介绍2：字幕滤镜、渲染器

    DirectVobSub/Vsfilter、FFdshow Subtitle Renderer

    VMR、EVR、Haali、MadVR

    10.一些杂七杂八的事情

目前计划用'markdown'来写作，用'github+jekyll'来host。不过最近比较忙，什么时候完工真的是未知数……

### Why we need a tutorial for a software already very easy to use?
Because some users don't know much about terms like AVC/H.264 or 10bits. On the other hand they ask why it dose not function as supposed or is there any more stuffs to improve the experience.
They are interested in learning more and becoming an advanced user.

### So who will read it?
Maybe no one, but I don't care

### Why using LaTeX?
I'm a Windows user and it was very difficult for me to do something regarded ease under Linux, for example compiling ProGit. If I were Ninja, maybe I could manage it. And I've read some introductions to Markdown and Docbook and decide to use a tool that I happend to (partly) understand. Well, LaTeX seems sophiscated but it will be far better than MS Office Word.

### Why using markdown?
Because it is simpler than html and well-supported by Github Pages and jekyll. In addition, with existing tools like pandoc, it can be easily converted to other doctypes like pdf.
